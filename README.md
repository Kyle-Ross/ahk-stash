# ahk-stash
A place to edit and manage my various AutoHotKey files which I use to streamline work at home and in the office.

Includes a series of functions enabling custom run behaviour with Single press to open, minimise or maximise a program, and Double press to open a copy.

Path information for hotkey targets is referenced from a locally stored txt file.
